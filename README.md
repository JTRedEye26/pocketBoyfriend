This is a small tamagotchi like game I made from my girlfriend before she went to collage.

I made this right after I made DungenTale so around 2018 but this game was made entirly by myself.

The game does have sound when running the code with an editor but when compiled into a .jar file the sound doesn't work. 

This was my first attempt at basic animations and custimization of the player.
