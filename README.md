This is a small tamagotchi like game I made for my girlfriend before she went to college.

I did this right after I made DungenTale so around 2018 but this game was made entirely by myself.

The game does have sound when running the code with an editor, but when compiled into a .Jar file the sound doesn't work. 

This was my first attempt at basic animations and customization of the player.
